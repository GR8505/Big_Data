## Executive Overview

**Who are vine customers?**
Amazon Vine invites are the most trusted reviewers on Amazon who post opinions about new and pre-release 
items to help their fellow customers make informed purchase decisions. Customers become Vine Voices based 
on their reviewer rank. This program was created to provide customers with more honest and unbiased feedback 
from some of Amazon's most trusted reviewers.

**Key Findings**
1) In the video games category, there is a total of just 4,290 vine customers compared to 
   1,781,596 non-vine customers.
2) Non-vine customers recorded the highest number of Total Votes as well as Helpful Votes.  
3) Both vine and non-vine reviews received similar average ratings of 4.07 and 4.06, 
   respectively.

   compared to non-vine customers (2.26).
5) Furthermore, non-vine customers received the lion's share of five star ratings (1,025,249) 
   and the highest ratio of five star ratings per customer (0.58) compared to vine reviewers
   (1,607 and 0.37).  
6) Nevertheless, vine customers were less likely to provide ratings on the lower end of the spectrum.
   The ratio of vine customers that gave one star ratings were 0.01 compared to 0.11 for non-vine
